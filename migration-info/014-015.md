# v0.14 -> v0.15 migration guide

## Removed Requests+

As we said [before](/migration-info/013-014.html#deprecated-requests), Requests+ features are totally removed in 0.15.  
Passing `options` won't do anything.  

## Removed ApiQueue

After [Spawner API](/anatomy/spawner.html) release, there are no need in `ApiQueue` because of duplicated logic:

```js
// <=0.15
import { ApiQueue } from '@apicase/core'

const queue = new ApiQueue()

queue.push(SomeService.doRequest, { url: '/foo' })
queue.push(SomeService.doRequest, { url: '/bar' })
queue.push(SomeService.doRequest, { url: '/baz' })
```

```js
// 0.15+
import { ApiSpawner } from '@apicase/spawner'

const spawner = new ApiSpawner({
  mode: "queue",
  base: SomeService
})

/* Spawn requests */
spawner.spawn({ url: "/foo" })
spawner.spawn({ url: "/bar" })
spawner.spawn({ url: "/baz" })
```

So, you have to get rid of `ApiQueue` in order to `ApiSpawner` with `queue` mode.

## Removed ApiService

`ApiService` is now totally removed from `@apicase/core` package. Use `@apicase/services` instead.
