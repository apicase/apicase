# v0.13 -> v0.14 migration guide

## Deprecated Requests+

Since [Spawner API](/anatomy/spawner.html) is released there are no longer need in delayed requests.

It means that all `options` will be deprecated.

For example, instead of:

```javascript
const req = doRequest({
  url: '/smth'
  options: {
    immediate: false,
    debounce: 500
  }
})
```

You should use:

```javascript
const spawner = new ApiSpawner({
  mode: 'debounce',
  time: 500
})

const req = spawner.spawn({ url: '/smth' })
```

## Moved ApiService

`ApiService` moved from `@apicase/core` to `@apicase/services` package

You should just fix your imports:

```javascript
// <=0.13
import { ApiService } from '@apicase/core'

// 0.14+
import { ApiService } from '@apicase/services'
```
